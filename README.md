This script detects coins and draw a countour on them. It also calculates the total sum, the number of coins and shows how much coins you have for each type of coin.
I tested this for romanian coins RON and don't expect to work on every type of coins. Because the difference between 1 ban and 5 bani is so small I didn't use 1 ban.
